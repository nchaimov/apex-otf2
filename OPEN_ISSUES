                         OTF2 v2.0 OPEN ISSUES
                         =====================

                                                           Status: Nov 2015

This file lists known limitations and unimplemented features of
the OTF2 component.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Platform support

  - OTF2 has been tested on the following platforms:
    + IBM Blue Gene/Q, only static libraries supported
    + IBM SP & BladeCenter clusters, only static libraries supported
    + SGI Altix/ICE
    + Cray XE6, XK7
    + various Linux/Intel (x86/x64) clusters
    + Mac OS X
    + MinGW (but SIONlib is known to not work on this platform)
    The provided configure options (see INSTALL) may provide a good
    basis for building and testing the toolset on other systems.

  - The following platforms have not been tested recently:
    + IBM Blue Gene/P
    + Cray XK6
    + Sun Solaris/SPARC-based clusters
    However the supplied buildsystem might still work on these
    systems.

  - The following platforms have not been tested:
    + Cray XT3/4, XT5
    + NEC SX-9
    + IBM Blue Gene/L
    + SiCortex systems
    + other NEC SX systems

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* OTF2 misc.

  - ZLIB compression of trace files is disabled.

  - The MODIFY mode of OTF2, which can be used to rewrite time stamps
    in trace files, is untested.

  - OTF2 currently assumes "homogeneous" systems, meaning that the 
    clocks of all nodes/cores run at the same clock frequency.
